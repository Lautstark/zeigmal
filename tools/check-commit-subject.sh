# Two things ask this question and they must not answer it differently:
#
#   .githooks/commit-msg                     one message, as it is written
#   .github/workflows/commit-messages.yml    every commit in a push to main
#
# The hook is a convenience and is opt-in per clone; CI is the gate. Neither
# carries a copy of the rule, because a rule that exists twice gets relaxed
# once and then the two disagree about what landed.

# Exit 0 = acceptable, or deliberately exempt. Exit 1 = not a conventional
# commit, with the reason on stderr.

Not a conventional commit:

  $subject

The prefix says what a commit is before the sentence says what it does, and
it is what makes a one-line log skimmable across a repository that holds an
Android app and a plain-JVM Kartensatz reader. Put it in front of the
sentence you were going to write anyway.

  feat:      a capability that was not there before
  fix:       something that was wrong is now right
  perf:      the same thing, faster
  refactor:  the same behaviour, arranged differently
  docs:      prose
  test, build, ci, chore:  everything else

  feat!: or a "BREAKING CHANGE:" trailer marks a breaking change

A scope is optional and is a path-ish word, not a sentence: fix(cardset):,
docs(releasing):.

Keep writing the subject the way this repository always has - a sentence that
says what changed, in the present tense. The prefix goes in front of it:

  feat: start the video the moment a card is seen
  fix: refuse a manifest whose video path points out of the Kartensatz

MSG
exit 1
